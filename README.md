The backend file(REST API) is stored in the lorem-shoe folder.
The BootstrapRedesigned folder contains the newly redesigned website with bootstrap.
The fetch Api folder contains javascript files that consume the REST API.
The src file contains the original website before redesigning.

The two features that the REST API is made for are the like feature and the buy feature.

In addition to the implementation of authentication and authorization with jwt, salt encryption using bcrypt module was made on the passwords.

The database used for this project is mysql. Mysql is a relational database which is suitable for authentication purposes. Moreover, since it is suitable for tabular data mysql was used. Most of our data is stored in tables.
